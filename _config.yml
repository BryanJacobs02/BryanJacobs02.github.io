  Hello! I graduated from SUNY Geneseo with a degree in Mathematics in 2024, where I gained experience in theoretical mathematics as well as applied mathematics, particularly in statistical programming. Since then I have been in Tucson, Arizona pursuing my Master's Degree in Data Science. At the U of A, I have developed a deep curiosity for biological systems, and a growing passion for bioinformatics and computational biology.
  <br><br>
  I have been exploring the intersection of data science and life sciences—where machine learning, high-throughput sequencing data, and statistical models can directly impact human health and scientific discovery. I am happy to have gained hands-on experience with RNA-seq data processing pipelines, using tools such as FastQC, STAR, featureCounts, and DESeq2 (in RStudio), as well as high-performance computing workflows in Unix/Linux environments.
  <br><br>
  Beyond bioinformatics, my true passions—snowboarding, hiking, and traveling, to name a few—revolve around the outdoors and the natural beauty the Earth has to offer. I’m driven by the idea of using data and technology as a force for good; whether that means improving patient care, advancing renewable energy, or expanding access to education. I’m always looking to learn, collaborate, and contribute to projects that align with these values.
