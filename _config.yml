  Hello! I graduated from SUNY Geneseo in 2024 with a degree in Mathematics, where I developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied mathematics, particularly in statistical programming. I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at the University of Arizona, where I have deepened my interest in bioinformatics and data science.
  <br><br>
 My career goal is to work in a field where I can make a tangible impact, such as healthcare, renewable energy, or education. I am passionate about using data science to address real-world challenges, and Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills in these areas. I have gained technical experience in areas like bioinformatics, but I am open to broadening my focus to any sector where data can drive meaningful change. I am currently seeking internships in data science or bioinformatics to further develop my expertise and contribute to impactful projects.
